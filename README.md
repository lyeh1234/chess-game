Project Overview:

Portfolio Project for CS162 at OSU. Using Python I built a chess game 
(variant of chess called Xianqi) where players play on a text-based chess 
board using unique pieces that were created using object-oriented programming.
Project focuses on the concept of classes and objects.

Hit run to play the game and see chess pieces update their positions, eliminate
enemy pieces, and print a message on whether the game status is in check, 
stalemate, checkmate, or next player's turn.
